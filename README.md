# Supply-Chain-Management-Demand-Forecasting

🚀 Objective:
This project focuses on optimizing supply chain operations using data analysis & machine learning. The goal is to:
✅ Predict product demand using machine learning
✅ Analyze supplier & shipping performance
✅ Optimize inventory & cost efficiency

📊 Dataset Overview:
The dataset includes key features like:
🔹 Product Information: Product Type, SKU, Price, Availability
🔹 Sales & Revenue Data: Historical Sales, Revenue Generated
🔹 Supply Chain Details: Supplier Name, Lead Time, Shipping Cost, Shipping Carrier
🔹 Manufacturing & Logistics: Production Volume, Transportation Route, Inspection Result

🔍 Data Preprocessing & EDA:
1️⃣ Missing values handled for numerical & categorical data
2️⃣ Categorical features encoded (One-Hot Encoding & Label Encoding)
3️⃣ EDA performed to understand trends:

Price vs Revenue analysis
Supplier-wise Shipping Cost analysis
Stock Levels vs Sales Trends
📈 Machine Learning Model: Demand Forecasting
🔹 Features used: Price, Availability, Stock Levels, Lead Time, Shipping Cost
🔹 Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor
🔹 Model Performance Metrics:

✅ Mean Squared Error (MSE) → Measures prediction accuracy
✅ R² Score → Measures how well model explains variance
📦 Supply Chain Optimization Insights:
✅ Best Supplier Identified → Based on lowest Lead Time & Cost
✅ Best Shipping Carrier Suggested → For lowest shipping cost
✅ Future Sales Predicted → Helps in stock & inventory planning

📌 Final Outcome & Impact:
🚀 Data-driven insights help reduce supply chain costs
🚀 Accurate demand forecasting minimizes overstock/shortage issues
🚀 Better supplier selection improves efficiency
